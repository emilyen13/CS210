# CS210

I am choosing to submit project 3 for my portfolio. In project three I needed to implement a method in Python that opened and read a file, wrote out to a new file and then had C++ read that newly written file. We had to combine these two languages to organize the product purchaed from the corner grocer. I think I did a really good job with my menu in C++ as well as writing sound and simple code in Python to complete the tasks I was asked to. If I could change the project I would have made the histogram in python as well, instead of writing out to a file and then making the histogram there. The other thing I would fix if we had more time on that project would be formatting the histogram so that the stars started printing at the same point, so that you could better see a comparison in quantity. I found it most challenging to have C++ open out written dat file and print the numbers as asteriks. I used previous assignments in this class, zyBooks and stackoverflow to help me find a solution to my roadblocks. I think this class and in particular this project was a great introduction to implementing multiple languages and having them work together. This will absolutely be a transferble practice for future coursework and jobs. My project 3 is maintainable and readable due to my code comments as well as naming practices. I think it would be really easy for anyone to jump into this code and undrstand my thought process and edit it as needed.
